# mern-stack-expense-tracker-app
This is an expense tracker app based on MERN ( MongoDB, Express, React, Node ) stack. <br/><br/>
Its client side is made in React using React hooks and context API + useReducer() hook for the state management. <br/><br/>
In the backend, I have used Express.js for the server side handling and MongoDB for storing the transactions in the database.<br/><br/>
